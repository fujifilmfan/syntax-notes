The notes in this directory were based on the Codecademy ["Learn Data Analysis with Pandas"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/data-processing-pandas) course, taken March and June 2020.

The motivation was to understand enough of the basics of the library to start analyzing the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data for my Covid by County project.  Getting that understanding was pretty quick, so I stopped working on the course.  In June, I picked it up again in order to finish it before subscription expiry and learn some more advanced concepts.
